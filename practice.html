            <p>Hi, as India is a vibrant conuntry, I also have a vibrant learning journey.
                As a brginner I was very facinated by the word called "hacker". But as I went to my dream path I got to know
                that nothing goes as simple as it is shown in any movie.
                I purchased a course and I started learning ethical hacking, But soon I realised that neither I am ready nor
                I had that equipments for that type of work execution.
